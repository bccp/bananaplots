# bananaplots
A simple tool for making banana plots from several multi-dimensional point datasets.

The term banana here refers to the usual shape of the contours of two feature projection of the datasets. See the gallery to see the graphical motivation. 

We'd like the tool to drive matplotlib. Declarative.

The distribution of points are internally modelled with gaussian mixture.
